            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="tagline">"Do not, under any circumstances, put code that you wrote you wrote for any
                assignment on the internet"</div>

            <p>
                This sentimentâ€”and many others like itâ€”were repeatedly shoved down my throat during my undergrad. I
                understand the intent: they didn't want students to copy each other's work. But the messaging was so
                extreme that, even to this day, most of the code I wrote in college hasn't been backed up in any
                meaningful wayâ€”not even to a private repository. That's something I'm slowly starting to change.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shortly after graduation, I realized I needed some kind of portfolio to showcase my workâ€”both the
                projects I created for school and the personal ones I tackled in my free time. While web development has
                never been a specific career goal, I did take a web programming class in college, so I decided to build
                a website to highlight what I've been working on.
            </p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>LinkedIn isâ€¦ fine. It's fine. But I really wanted a space where I could share both my personal projects
                and tech-adjacent hobbiesâ€”things that don't quite fit in with the highly professional (and often a bit
                stuffy) tone of LinkedIn. I want to present my work while still being unapologetically myself. In
                building this website, I set out to accomplish a few things that are harder to do on LinkedIn or other
                career-focused platforms:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create detailed write-ups of the projects I've built</li>
                <li>Highlight specific skills I've developed</li>
                <li>Give potential employers and clients a clear picture of who I am and what I can do</li>
                <li>Give myself an excuse to explore and learn more about web development</li>
                <li>Have some fun building building a website from scratch</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
            <p>I took exactly one (!) web programming class in college. To be completely honest, web development never
                really intrigued me. I felt (and still feel) that markup languages like HTML and XML often lack helpful
                whitespace, which makes them hard to read. I also didn't love having to use three different languages
                for a single projectâ€”it felt a bit unfocused to me.</p>

            <p>Still, I decided to give web programming another fair shot, and honestly, it's turned out okay! I'm still
                easing back into it, so it was important to me to understand the basics before jumping into more
                advanced web technologies. For now, the tech stack for this site is fairly simple:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>CSS</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Vanilla Javascript</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Git</strong> - Version Control</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> - Hosting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I wanted to create something approachable and minimal, but flexible enough to adapt as my needs evolved.
                I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in designâ€”many of the decisions I made for this site were pulled
                from, and remixed from, other websites I enjoy visiting. Even the dual-header design wasn't something I
                initially planned until I started paying closer attention to layouts I saw while browsing.</p>

            <p>The choice to use a dark background with light text comes from my programming roots: staring at black
                text on a bright white background all day hurts my soul. I wanted to mimic the color scheme of my
                code editor, but with a bit more visual polish. Some of my less tech-savvy friends don't quite get the
                appeal, so I may add a theme toggle at some point to appease themâ€”even if I think they're wrong ðŸ™ƒ</p>

            <p>I also wanted the design to work well on mobile devices. Responsive design was important to me, so I've
                made sure the site scales elegantlyâ€”even on the smallest phones currently available.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <p>While building this site, I ended up creating a number of smallâ€”but meaningfulâ€”features that help
                everything feel a bit more polished. Many of them are easy to overlook when they're working well, but
                once they're gone, you definitely notice. Below are some of the key features I've added to improve
                usability, accessibility, and the overall user experience.</p>

            <h3>Responsive Layout</h3>
            <p>The site is built to look great across a wide range of devices, from large desktop monitors to compact
                mobile phones. I've used flexible containers and media queries to ensure content resizes and reflows
                naturally, maintaining readability and usability no matter the screen size.</p>

            <h3>Dynamic Header and Footer Loading</h3>
            Rather than repeating HTML across every page, I use JavaScript to dynamically load shared header and footer
            content. This makes it easy to update navigation or layout site-wide without needing to touch every single
            fileâ€”keeping things consistent and a lot more maintainable.

            <h3>Reusable Components</h3>
            I've started building out small reusable components to speed up development and reduce clutter. A great
            example is the Table of Contents element, which I add on longer project pages. It not only helps with
            navigation, but keeps the layout feeling consistent and organized.

            <h3>CSS Theming</h3>
            <p>To keep things both visually cohesive and easy to tweak, I rely heavily on CSS variables. This lets me
                maintain a consistent color palette across the site and quickly adjust things like font sizes, link
                colors, or backgroundsâ€”all from one place.</p>

            <h3>Code Syntax Highlighting</h3>
            <p>When discussing technical topics, clean and readable code blocks are a must. I've integrated code syntax
                highlighting (using <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank">Highlight JS</a>) so that code
                samples stand out with proper formatting and color-coding. It makes the code easier to scan and just
                looks better overall.</p>
