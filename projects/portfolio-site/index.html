                        How I built this site:
                        <a href="/projects/portfolio-site/index.html" target="_self">
                            ottles91.github.io/projects/portfolio-site/index.html

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="tagline">"Do not, under any circumstances, put code that you wrote you wrote for any
                assignment on the internet"</div>

            <p>
                This sentiment—and many others like it—were repeatedly shoved down my throat during my undergrad. I
                understand the intent: they didn't want students to copy each other's work. But the messaging was so
                extreme that, even to this day, most of the code I wrote in college hasn't been backed up in any
                meaningful way—not even to a private repository. That's something I'm slowly starting to change.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shortly after graduation, I realized I needed some kind of portfolio to showcase my work—both the
                projects I created for school and the personal ones I tackled in my free time. While web development has
                never been a specific career goal, I did take a web programming class in college, so I decided to build
                a website to highlight what I've been working on.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>LinkedIn is… fine. It's fine. But I really wanted a space where I could share both my personal projects
                and tech-adjacent hobbies—things that don't quite fit in with the highly professional (and often a bit
                stuffy) tone of LinkedIn. I want to present my work while still being unapologetically myself. In
                building this website, I set out to accomplish a few things that are harder to do on LinkedIn or other
                career-focused platforms:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create detailed write-ups of the projects I've built</li>
                <li>Highlight specific skills I've developed</li>
                <li>Give potential employers and clients a clear picture of who I am and what I can do</li>
                <li>Give myself an excuse to explore and learn more about web development</li>
                <li>Have some fun building building a website from scratch</li>
            </ul>
