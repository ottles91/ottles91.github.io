                    This sentiment—and many others like it—was repeatedly shoved down my throat during my undergrad. I
                    get
                    the
                    intent: they
                    didn't want students copying each other's work. But the messaging was so extreme that, even now,
                    most of
                    the code I
                    wrote in college hasn't been backed up in any meaningful way—not even to a private repository.
                    That's
                    something Im
                    slowly starting to change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shortly after graduation, I realized I needed a portfolio to showcase my work—both the projects I
                    created for school and
                    the personal ones I tackled in my free time. While web development has never been a specific career
                    goal, I did take a
                    web programming class in college, so I decided to build a website to highlight what I've been
                    working
                    on.

                <p>LinkedIn is… fine. It's fine. But I really wanted a space where I could share both personal projects
                    and
                    tech-adjacent hobbies—things that don't quite fit with the highly professional (and often slightly
                    stuffy) tone of LinkedIn. I want to present my work while still being unapologetically myself. In
                    building this website, I set out to accomplish a few things that are harder to do on LinkedIn or
                    other
                    career-focused platforms:
                </p>

                    <li>Create detailed write-ups of the projects I've built</li>
                    <li>Highlight specific skills I've developed</li>
                    <li>Give potential employers and clients a clear picture of who I am and what I can do</li>
                    <li>Give myself an excuse to explore and learn more about web development</li>
                    <li>Have some fun building a website from scratch</li>

                <p>I took exactly one (!) web programming class in college. To be honest, web development never really
                    intrigued me. I felt (and still feel) that markup languages like HTML and XML are just too difficult
                    to
                    read. I also didn't love using three different languages for a
                    single project—it felt a bit unfocused.</p>

                <p>Still, I decided to give web programming another fair shot, and honestly, it's turned out okay! I'm
                    still
                    easing back into it, so it was important to me to understand the basics before diving into more
                    advanced
                    web technologies. For now, the tech stack for this site is fairly simple:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>CSS</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Vanilla JavaScript</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Git</strong> - Version Control</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> - Hosting</li>
                </ul>

                </summary>
                <p>I wanted to create something approachable and minimal, but flexible enough to adapt as my needs
                    evolved.
                    I'm not going to pretend I'm a design expert—many of the decisions I made for this site were
                    borrowed
                    from and remixed based on websites I enjoy visiting. Even the dual-header layout wasn't something I
                    initially planned; it came from paying closer attention to the sites I frequent.</p>

                <p>The decision to use a dark background with light text comes from my programming roots: staring at
                    black
                    text on a bright white background all day hurts my soul. I wanted to emulate the color scheme of my
                    code
                    editor, but with a bit more visual polish. Some of my less tech-savvy friends don't quite get the
                    appeal, so I may add a theme toggle at some point to appease them—even if I think they're wrong 🙃
                </p>

                <p>I also wanted the design to work well on mobile devices. Responsive design was a priority, so I've
                    made
                    sure the site scales elegantly—even on the smallest phones currently available.

                <p>While building this site, I ended up creating a number of small—but meaningful—features that help
                    everything feel a bit more polished. Many of them are easy to overlook when they're working well,
                    but
                    once they're gone, you definitely notice. Below are some of the key features I've added to improve
                    usability, accessibility, and the overall user experience.</p>

                            alt="A screenshot of the mobile version of this page" class="screenshot-img" loading="lazy">
                        <figcaption class="screenshot-caption">The mobile version of this webpage</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <div class="screenshot-details">
                        <p>
                            One of the first major design updates I tackled was ensuring the website performed well on
                            phones and tablets. For the most part, this meant writing specific CSS rules for cases where
                            the
                            screen size dips below a certain threshold. These adjustments help keep text readable on
                            small
                            screens and ensure that key elements—like images—render in a way that improves visibility
                            and
                            usability.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also created desktop-specific CSS rules for images. On certain pages, text is allowed to
                            "wrap" around the right side of an image when viewed on a desktop. On mobile devices, those
                            same
                            images and text elements are stacked vertically instead. This provides a more dynamic layout
                            on
                            larger screens, while prioritizing readability and flow on smaller ones. This allows my
                            website
                            to take advantage of the strengths that are unique to each form factor.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    On the desktop version of the site, there's enough horizontal space to display links to different
                    site
                    sections directly in the top navigation bar. On mobile, however, screen space is more limited. To
                    solve
                    this, I implemented a “hamburger menu” that keeps navigation accessible without taking up
                    unnecessary
                    real estate.
                </p>

            <!-- Dynamic Header and Footer Injection -->
            <details open class="collapsible-section">

                    <span class="summary-title" id="injection">Dynamic Header and Footer Injection</span>
                </summary>

                <p>Rather than repeating HTML across every page, I use JavaScript to dynamically load shared header and
                    footer content. Each page on my website includes a simple placeholder element like this:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id="header-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>I then wrote a small JavaScript function that dynamically loads and injects external HTML into the
                    page:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-javascript" data-code-id="include-html"></code></pre>
                <script type="text/plain" data-code-id="include-html">
            function includeHTML(selector, url, callback) {
                fetch(url)
                    .then(response => response.text())
                    .then(data => {
                        const container = document.querySelector(selector);
                        if (container) {
                            container.innerHTML = data;
                            if (typeof callback === "function") {
                                callback();
                            }
                        }
                    })
                    .catch(error => {
                        console.error(`Failed to include ${url}:`, error);
                    });
            }
            </script>
                <p>This script handles the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Takes a CSS selector (such as <code>#header-placeholder</code>)</li>
                    <li>Fetches an external HTML file (like <code>header.html</code>)</li>
                    <li>Injects the content of that file into the matching element on the page</li>
                    <li>Optionally executes a callback function after the injection</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This approach lets me store the header and footer in separate HTML files and insert them dynamically
                    at
                    load time. It's a simple and effective way to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
                    principle—without
                    relying on any frameworks or build tools.</p>

                <p>I've started building small reusable components to speed up development and reduce clutter. A great

                    navigation but also keeps the layout consistent and organized.</p>

                <p>I combine it with some custom CSS to ensure it fits cleanly into the design of each page while

                </summary>
                <p>I wanted a way to share code snippets that preserved the formatting and readability you'd expect from
                    a
                    modern IDE. While HTML includes basic <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags, they didn't offer the level of
                    clarity or control I was looking for.</p>
                <p>I turned to <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank">Highlight.js</a> to
                    format and highlight my code blocks. Highlight.js provides syntax-aware highlighting across multiple
                    languages, making my code easier to read and more visually engaging for anyone familiar with
                    programming.</p>

            <!-- CSS Theming -->

                <summary>
                    <span class="summary-title" id="csstheming">CSS Theming</span>
                </summary>
                <p>
                    To keep things visually cohesive and easy to tweak, I rely heavily on CSS custom properties
                    (variables).
                    These are defined at the root level and serve as a central source of truth for values like colors,
                    fonts, and spacing. This allows me to apply a consistent theme across the site while making future
                    changes fast and painless—if I want to try a new accent color or adjust padding, I only need to
                    update a
                    single variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, my color palette includes variables like <code>--header-bg</code>,
                    <code>--footer-bg</code>, and <code>--link-color-body</code>, which control styling for site-wide
                    elements. I also use variables for typography and layout—such as <code>--font-family-header</code>
                    and
                    <code>--padding</code>—to keep everything flexible and readable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach not only improves maintainability, but also lays the groundwork for future
                    enhancements
                    like light/dark mode toggles or user-selectable themes, which could be implemented simply by
                    swapping
                    variable values in a different theme context.

            <!-- Design & UX Decisions -->
            <details open class="collapsible-section">
                <summary>

                </summary>
                <p>While I'm building this website primarily to showcase my technical skills, it was also important to
                    me
                    that the design feel approachable and familiar to all users. I wanted the basic building
                    blocks—especially the header and footer—to reflect patterns visitors already recognize from other
                    websites. My initial header was very simple: a single horizontal row of navigation links.</p>

                <p>
                    Shortly after setting that up, I started paying closer attention to how other sites approached their
                    header design. I noticed a common trend—many sites use a stacked (or dual-layer) header, with the
                    top
                    layer focused on branding and the bottom layer dedicated to navigation. I decided to adopt that same
                    approach for my site. Not only did it help reinforce my personal branding, but it also aligned my
                    layout
                    more closely with the design patterns users already expect to see online.

                    While I initially envisioned this website as a simple way to showcase my personal projects, it's
                    grown
                    into something much more meaningful. I've found that I genuinely enjoy working on it—it's become a
                    space
                    for creativity, learning, and continual refinement. I'm always coming up with new tweaks and ideas
                    to
                    push my web development skills further and improve the site overall. My hope is that this site will
                    keep
                    evolving to meet my needs for years to come.
