            <p class="tagline">A page about creating my site… on my site. How delightfully recursive</p>

                        How I built this site:
                        <a href="/projects/portfolio-site/index.html" target="_self">
                            ottles91.github.io/projects/portfolio-site/index.html

                        <div class="tagline">Warning! Link may be recursive</div>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tagline">"Do not, under any circumstances, put code that you wrote you wrote for any
                assignment on the internet"</div>

            <p>
                This sentiment—and many others like it—were repeatedly shoved down my throat during my undergrad. I
                understand the intent: they didn't want students to copy each other's work. But the messaging was so
                extreme that, even to this day, most of the code I wrote in college hasn't been backed up in any
                meaningful way—not even to a private repository. That's something I'm slowly starting to change.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shortly after graduation, I realized I needed some kind of portfolio to showcase my work—both the
                projects I created for school and the personal ones I tackled in my free time. While web development has
                never been a specific career goal, I did take a web programming class in college, so I decided to build
                a website to highlight what I've been working on.
