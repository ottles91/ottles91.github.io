            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="tagline">"Do not, under any circumstances, put code that you wrote you wrote for any
                assignment on the internet"</div>

            <p>
                This sentimentâ€”and many others like itâ€”were repeatedly shoved down my throat during my undergrad. I
                understand the intent: they didn't want students to copy each other's work. But the messaging was so
                extreme that, even to this day, most of the code I wrote in college hasn't been backed up in any
                meaningful wayâ€”not even to a private repository. That's something I'm slowly starting to change.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shortly after graduation, I realized I needed some kind of portfolio to showcase my workâ€”both the
                projects I created for school and the personal ones I tackled in my free time. While web development has
                never been a specific career goal, I did take a web programming class in college, so I decided to build
                a website to highlight what I've been working on.
            </p>

            <!-- TODO: Consider adding a ToC? -->

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>LinkedIn isâ€¦ fine. It's fine. But I really wanted a space where I could share both my personal projects
                and tech-adjacent hobbiesâ€”things that don't quite fit in with the highly professional (and often a bit
                stuffy) tone of LinkedIn. I want to present my work while still being unapologetically myself. In
                building this website, I set out to accomplish a few things that are harder to do on LinkedIn or other
                career-focused platforms:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create detailed write-ups of the projects I've built</li>
                <li>Highlight specific skills I've developed</li>
                <li>Give potential employers and clients a clear picture of who I am and what I can do</li>
                <li>Give myself an excuse to explore and learn more about web development</li>
                <li>Have some fun building building a website from scratch</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
            <p>I took exactly one (!) web programming class in college. To be completely honest, web development never
                really intrigued me. I felt (and still feel) that markup languages like HTML and XML often lack helpful
                whitespace, which makes them hard to read. I also didn't love having to use three different languages
                for a single projectâ€”it felt a bit unfocused to me.</p>

            <p>Still, I decided to give web programming another fair shot, and honestly, it's turned out okay! I'm still
                easing back into it, so it was important to me to understand the basics before jumping into more
                advanced web technologies. For now, the tech stack for this site is fairly simple:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML</strong></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>CSS</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Vanilla Javascript</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Git</strong> - Version Control</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> - Hosting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I wanted to create something approachable and minimal, but flexible enough to adapt as my needs evolved.
                I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in designâ€”many of the decisions I made for this site were pulled
                from, and remixed from, other websites I enjoy visiting. Even the dual-header design wasn't something I
                initially planned until I started paying closer attention to layouts I saw while browsing.</p>

            <p>The choice to use a dark background with light text comes from my programming roots: staring at black
                text on a bright white background all day hurts my soul. I wanted to mimic the color scheme of my
                code editor, but with a bit more visual polish. Some of my less tech-savvy friends don't quite get the
                appeal, so I may add a theme toggle at some point to appease themâ€”even if I think they're wrong ðŸ™ƒ</p>

            <p>I also wanted the design to work well on mobile devices. Responsive design was important to me, so I've
                made sure the site scales elegantlyâ€”even on the smallest phones currently available.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <p>While building this site, I ended up creating a number of smallâ€”but meaningfulâ€”features that help
                everything feel a bit more polished. Many of them are easy to overlook when they're working well, but
                once they're gone, you definitely notice. Below are some of the key features I've added to improve
                usability, accessibility, and the overall user experience.</p>

            <h3>Responsive Layout</h3>

            <p>The site is built to look great across a wide range of devices, from large desktop monitors to compact
                mobile phones. I've used flexible containers and relative units to allow content to resize smoothly,
                along with targeted media queries to adjust layouts at common breakpoints (e.g., 768px for tablets,
                480px for phones).</p>

            <p>On smaller screens, navigation switches to a hamburger menu for better usability, and certain elements
                like social icons shift position to avoid clutter. Font sizes, padding, and margins adapt to improve
                readability and touch accessibility. While the layout is responsive, I've also tried to ensure that
                performance and visual hierarchy are preserved regardless of the screen size.</p>

            <!-- TODO: INCLUDE SOMETHING ABOUT THE HAMBURGER MENU!!!! -->

            <h3>Dynamic Header and Footer Loading</h3>

            <p>Rather than repeating HTML across every page, I use JavaScript to dynamically load shared header and
                footer content. Every page on my website includes the following HTML snippet:</p>

            <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id="header-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>I then wrote a simple JavaScript function that dynamically loads and injects external HTML into the page:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript" data-code-id="include-html"></code></pre>
            <script type="text/plain" data-code-id="include-html">
            function includeHTML(selector, url, callback) {
                fetch(url)
                    .then(response => response.text())
                    .then(data => {
                        const container = document.querySelector(selector);
                        if (container) {
                            container.innerHTML = data;
                            if (typeof callback === "function") {
                                callback();
                            }
                        }
                    })
                    .catch(error => {
                        console.error(`Failed to include ${url}:`, error);
                    });
            }
            </script>

            <p>This script does the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Takes a CSS selector (such as <code>#header-placeholder</code>)</li>
                <li>Fetches an external HTML file (like <code>header.html</code>)</li>
                <li>Injects the content of that file into the matching element on the page</li>
                <li>Optionally executes a callback function after the injection</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This allows me to store the header and footer in their own separate HTML files and dynamically insert
                them into each page at load time. It's a clean way to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
                while sticking to plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>


            <h3>Reusable Components</h3>
            I've started building out small reusable components to speed up development and reduce clutter. A great
            example is the Table of Contents element, which I add on longer project pages. It not only helps with
            navigation, but keeps the layout feeling consistent and organized. This Table of Contents begins with an
            unordered list in HTML, an example of which is shown below:

            <pre><code class="language-html" data-code-id="toc-snippet"></code></pre>
            <script type="text/plain" data-code-id="toc-snippet">
      <div class="toc-wrapper">
        <button class="toc-master-toggle" aria-expanded="true">
          Table of Contents
        </button>
        <nav class="toc" id="toc-content">
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#overview">Overview</a></li>
            <li><a href="#background">Background</a></li>
            <li><a href="#dexorder">My Problem with National Pokedex Order</a></li>
            <li><a href="#techstack">Tech Stack</a></li>
            <li><a href="#features">Key Features</a></li>
            <li>
              <a href="#details">Technical Details</a>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="#architecture">Architecture</a></li>
                <li><a href="#algorithm">Algorithm Design</a></li>
                <li><a href="#edgecases">Edge Case Handling</a></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#whatilearned">What I Learned</a></li>
            <li><a href="#upcomingfeatures">Upcoming Features</a></li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      </div>
            </script>

            <p>This is combined with some CSS to help with the styling to make the Table of Contents element fit in
                nicely on the page.</p>

            <h3>Code snippets</h3>
            <p>I've also created a reusable element that I use to show off code snippets, such as the Table of Contents
                snippet seen above. This setup allows me to utilize <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank">
                    Highlight.js</a> to display code snippets in a way that is both readable and familiar to anyone who
                has spent any amount of time devloping software.
            </p>

            <h3>CSS Theming</h3>
            <p>
                To keep things both visually cohesive and easy to tweak, I rely heavily on CSS custom properties
                (variables). These variables are defined at the root level and act as a central source of truth for
                common values like colors, fonts, and spacing. This allows me to apply a consistent theme across the
                site while making future changes fast and painlessâ€”if I decide to try a different accent color or adjust
                padding, I only need to update a single variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, my color palette includes variables like <code>--header-bg</code>,
                <code>--footer-bg</code>, and <code>--link-color-body</code>, which control site-wide elements. I also
                use variables for typography and layoutâ€”such as <code>--font-family-header</code> and
                <code>--padding</code>â€”to keep things flexible and readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach not only promotes maintainability, but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements
                like light/dark mode toggles or user-selectable themes, which can be implemented simply by swapping
                variable values in a different theme context.
            </p>


            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>This has been both my biggest overall web project as well as the first web project I've taken on in
                several years. As of the time of writing I've been working on this project for a little over a month
                now, with multiple commits to my repository during each weekday. Even at this early stage I've overcome
                multiple challenges and learned many new skills that have helped me learn and grow as a developer.</p>

            <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>One of the first large updates I tackled related to design was to ensure that the website performed well
                on phones and tablets. For the most part this simply involves creating specific CSS rules for instances
                where the screen size dips below a certain threshold. This helps ensure that text remains readable on
                small screens, and specific elements, like images render in a way that increases their visibility on
                smaller screens</p>

            <p>I created some desktop-specific CSS rules around images. On certain pages, the page content will be
                allowed to "wrap" around the right side of an image on the desktop version of the page, but on mobile
                the images and text will be stacked vertically. This allows for a more dynamic layout that better takes
                advantage of the additional screen space available on desktop browsers, while also allowing the mobile
                site to prioritize readability for a small screen.</p>

            <p>On the desktop version of the website I have enough room to display links to the different site sections
                across the top of the navigation header. On mobile, horizontal space is much more limited. Because of
                this I implemented a "Hamburger Menu" on mobile, which keeps the different sections of the site
                accessible without taking away from screen space unnecessarily</p>

            <h3>Dynamic Content Injection</h3>
            <p>Because I'm relying on vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript (at least for this inital version of the site) I
                wanted a way to reduce the amount of repeated code segments on the site. I quickly realized that both my
                site header and footer were always going to be universal elements that wouldn't change between pages. I
                didn't want to have update them across every page whenever I wanted to make a small change to their
                implementation. To address this, I created a system that dynamically injects my stand-along header and
                footer HTML files into each page.</p>

            <h3>Code Block Formatting</h3>
            <p>As discussed previously, I wanted a system that allowed me to share snippets of my own code in a way that
                maintained the formatting and readibility that you'd find in any modern IDE. HTML does include support
                for simple code tags, but that didn't give me the depth and flexibility that I was looking for. As
                dicussed previously, I turned to <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank"> Highlight.js</a> to
                help me format and highlight my code blocks in a way that would be readable to anyone familiar with
                programming.</p>

            <h3>Design & UX Decisions</h3>
            <p>While I am creating this website largely to showcase my technical skills, it was important to me to
                ensure that I created a design that was approachable to all users. I wanted the basic building blocks,
                especially the header and footer to be familiar to what visitors might see on other websites. My initial
                header was very simple, simply containing a list of links to different sections of the site arranged
                hoizontally across the header itself. </p>

            <p>Shortly after creating my initial header I started paying attention to how header designs on other
                websites differed from my own. I noticed that a popular design norm was to have two layers to the
                header: The top layer focusing on branding, and the lower focused on navigation links. I decided that I
                wanted to implement this stacked (or duel-layer) header design on my own site to help establish my own
                personal brand, as well as to try to stay within in the norms of general website design that I observed
                elsewhere on the internet. </p>

            <h2>Future Updates</h2>
            <p>While I initially envisioned this website as a simple way for me to showcase personal projects, it has
                quickly become much more than that. I've found that it's now something unique that I really enjoy
                working on. I'm always thinking of new tweaks and changes that I want to make to further my own web
                development skills, as well as to improve the website overall. My hope is that this site can continue to
                improve and change to fit my needs for many years to come!</p>
