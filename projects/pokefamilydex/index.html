        <p>
          This Python script generates a clean, human-readable National
          Dex-ordered list of Pokémon grouped by evolutionary family. This is a
          passion project of mine. I've always wanted to organize my Pokemon
          Home boxes by Pokemon family, but as far as I can tell there is no
          resource out there that clealy organizes Pokemon by family. I wanted
          to create a tool that would allow me to do this, and I hope it will be
          useful to others as well. The script is designed to be run in a Python
          environment and outputs the list in a text format that can be easily
          copied into a document or spreadsheet.

          <p>
            I've enjoyed Pokémon since I was a child. I fondly remember going to
            my friend's house and playing <strong>Pokémon Red</strong> on his
            GameBoy Color. Sometimes he would let me borrow his GameBoy, and I
            would take it home and play for hours, desperately trying to get as
            far as I could.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember struggling to beat Brock with my Charmander. It made
            perfect sense to me — with enough heat, rocks could melt, so
            obviously my fire-type Charmander could beat Brock's Onix.
            Unfortunately, I didn't really understand how type matchups worked,
            and I always hit a wall there.
          </p>

          <p>
            What intrigued me about Pokemon wasn't the battling — I was never
            great at it, and honestly, I still don't find it that particuraly
            fun. What I loved was the
            <strong>collection</strong> aspect. There was this big, long list of
            unknown Pokémon out there <strong>somewhere</strong>, waiting to be
            discovered. I loved running through tall grass, never knowing what
            I'd encounter next... it was magical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching my Pokédex slowly fill up was the most satisfying part of
            the game for me.
          </p>

          <h4>The Impetus</h4>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2016, <strong>Pokémon Go</strong> launched — and
            like many others, it pulled me back in. Most people I knew played
            for a couple months and then moved on. I didn't. Not only did I keep
            playing, but I also dove back into the main series games that I'd
            missed growing up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back then, there were only 150 Pokémon (or 151, if you counted the
            playground rumors about Mew hiding under a truck). Now there were
            over 800 — and I was once again hooked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next few years, I slowly played through
            <em>Alpha Sapphire</em>, <em>X</em>, and <em>Ultra Moon</em>.
            Between those three games, I was able to collect almost all
            available Pokémon (minus a few legendaries and event-only
            mythicals).
          </p>
          <p>
            That's when my organizational instincts kicked in. I wanted to put
            all of them in one place — in a way that felt
            <strong>logical</strong>.
          </p>
          </details>

          <details open class="collapsible-section">
            <summary>
              <span class="summary-title" id="dexorder">My Problem with National Pokedex Order</span>
            </summary>
          <p>
            The most common way to organize Pokémon is by their
            <strong>National Pokédex number</strong>, which lists Pokémon
            chronologically based on the region they were introduced in.
          </p>
          <p>
            While that makes sense historically, it always bothered me in one
            specific way: Pokémon families that were expanded in later
            generations often get split up. One of the clearest examples is the
            Mr. Mime line:
          </p>

          <ul class="pokemon-list"
            <li>Mime Jr.</li>
            <li>Mr. Mime</li>
            <li>Mr. Mime (Galarian Form)</li>
            <li>Mr. Rime</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In National Dex order, this family appears like this:</p>
          <ul class="pokemon-list">
            <li>Mr. Mime (Slot 122)</li>
            <li>Mime Jr. (Slot 439)</li>
            <li>Mr. Rime (Slot 866)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            That splits the family across hundreds of entries and ignores
            regional form differences. Galarian Mr. Mime often gets skipped
            entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another good usecase for organizing by family is the Eevee line.
            Eevee has a total of 8 evoultions, but they're spread across four
            different generations, meaning that they're not typically organized
            together. My script makes sure that the entire Eevee line can be
            seen together in one location:
          </p>
          <ul class="pokemon-list">
            <li>Eevee</li>
            <li>Vaporeon</li>
            <li>Jolteon</li>
            <li>Flareon</li>
            <li>Espeon</li>
            <li>Leafeon</li>
            <li>Glaceon</li>
            <li>Sylveon</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The generation 4 games (Diamond, Pearl and Platinum) in particular
            added nearly 30 Pokemon into previously-existing evolutionary
            families, many originating from Pokemon Red, Green, Blue and Yellow.
            I believe this generation in particular presents the strongest
            argument for organzing Pokemon by evolutionary family rather than
            strictly by Pokedex number. New additions to previouly-established
            Pokemon evolutionary lines include:
          </p>

          <ol class="pokemon-list">
            <li>Budew</li>
            <li>Roserade</li>
            <li>Ambipom</li>
            <li>Mismagius</li>
            <li>Honchkrow</li>
            <li>Chingling</li>
            <li>Bonsly</li>
            <li>Mime Jr.</li>
            <li>Happiny</li>
            <li>Munchlax</li>
            <li>Mantyke</li>
            <li>Weavile</li>
            <li>Magnezone</li>
            <li>Lickilicky</li>
            <li>Rhyperior</li>
            <li>Tangrowth</li>
            <li>Electivire</li>
            <li>Magmortar</li>
            <li>Togekiss</li>
            <li>Yanmega</li>
            <li>Leafeon</li>
            <li>Glaceon</li>
            <li>Gliscor</li>
            <li>Mamoswine</li>
            <li>Porygon-Z</li>
            <li>Gallade</li>
            <li>Probopass</li>
            <li>Dusknoir</li>
            <li>Froslass</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Over time, I realized how much I enjoyed seeing all of my Pokémon organized
            by their specific evolutionary families. I began manually sorting my collection 
            in Pokémon Home this way, but as new games were released—bringing with them new 
            forms and evolutions—it became increasingly difficult to keep everything 
            neatly organized. What started as a fun system quickly became tedious to maintain.
          </p>

          <h4>Why I Built This</h4>
          <p>
            After manually organizing my Pokémon in Pokémon Home more times than
            I'd like to admit, I realized:
            <strong>why not automate it?</strong> Instead of scrolling through
            spreadsheets and constantly dragging Pokémon into new boxes, I could
            write a script to group them by family — exactly the way I wanted —
            and output a clean, readable list.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is especially helpful for collectors. It's designed to
            group all members of a family together, even if they were introduced
            in different generations or have regional forms.
            <strong
              >No more missing evolutions, skipped forms, or scattered
              duplicates.</strong
            >
            It turns the National Dex into something that feels tailored to
            completionists and box-organizers like me.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal with this project was to create a listing that organizes
            Pokémon based on two priorities:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Evolutionary family</strong> comes first</li>
            <li>Then, <strong>National Pokédex order</strong></li>
          </ol>
