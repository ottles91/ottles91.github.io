        <p>
          This Python script generates a clean, human-readable National
          Dex-ordered list of Pok√©mon grouped by evolutionary family. This is a
          passion project of mine. I've always wanted to organize my Pokemon
          Home boxes by Pokemon family, but as far as I can tell there is no
          resource out there that clealy organizes Pokemon by family. I wanted
          to create a tool that would allow me to do this, and I hope it will be
          useful to others as well. The script is designed to be run in a Python
          environment and outputs the list in a text format that can be easily
          copied into a document or spreadsheet.

          <p>
            I've enjoyed Pokemon since I was a child. I fondly remember going to
            my friend's house and playing Pokemon Red on his GameBoy Color.
            Sometimes he would let me borrow it, and I would take it home and
            play the game for hours, desperately trying to get as far into the
            game as possible. I remember desperately trying to beat Brock with
            my Charmander. It made perfect sense to me: with enough heat, rocks
            could melt, so obviously my fire-type Charmander could beat Brock's
            Onix. Unfortunately, I didn't really understand how type matchups
            worked, and I always struggled to beat Brock.
          </p>
          <p>
            I loved the collection aspect of Pokemon. I was never really good at
            battling, and frankly, I still don't find it very fun. The
            collection aspect of the game is what hooked me. Having this big,
            long list of unknown Pokemon who were out there
            <strong>somewhere</strong> waiting to be caught was so exciting to
            me. I wanted to spend all of my time running around looking for them
            so I could discover what they looked like. Watching my Pokedex
            slowly filled up was the most satisfying part of the game for me.
          </p>
          <h4>The impetus</h4>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2016, Pokemon Go released, and like many others,
            brought me back to Pokemon. A lot of people played the game for a
            month or two after launch, and then slowly stopped playing. That
            didn't happen to me; Not only did I keep playing, but I dove back
            into the mainseries games and explored many of the games that had
            come out since I was a child. Growing up I had 150 (or 151 if you
            cound the playground rumors about Mew hiding underneath a truck)
            Pokemon to catch. Now there were over 800, and I was once again
            hooked on the collection aspect of the games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of a few years I slowly worked through some of the
            games I'd missed over the years: Alpha Sapphire, X, and Ultra Moon.
            Between these three games I was able to slowly collect almost all
            available Pokemon (save for some legendaries and event-only mythical
            ones) and this is where my orgaizational instict kicked in: I wanted
            to have a way to put all of these in one place and display them in
            some kind of logical order.
          </p>
          <h4>National Pokedex Order</h4>
          <p>
            The most common way to organize Pokemon is known as
            <strong>National Pokedex order</strong>, where Pokemon are organized
            chronologically by the region they were originally discovered in.
            While I think this ordering makes a lot of sense, it always bothered
            me in one specific way: Specific Pokemon families could separated
            based on when they were originally introduced. Take for example, the
            Mr. Mime evolution line:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mime Jr.</li>
            <li>Mr. Mime</li>
            <li>Mr. Mime (Galarian Form)</li>
            <li>Mr. Rime</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            National Pokedex order would organize them in the following order:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mr. Mime (slot 122)</li>
            <li>Mime Jr. (slot 439)</li>
            <li>Mr. Rime (slot 866)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This orders the Mr. Mime family based on when each subsequent
            addition was added to the games, but separates the entire family in
            the process. Additionally this ordering does not differentiate
            between Mr. Mime (Kanto) and Mr. Mime (Galar), which often results
            in the Galarian variant of Mr. Mime being excluded entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal with this project was to create a way to automatically build
            a list of Pokemon that anchors them in this order of priority:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Evolution Family</li>
            <li>National Pokedex order</li>
          </ol>
