        Apple Shortcuts Automations
      </h1>
      <p class="tagline">Don't just have an iPhone that looks and behaves like every other iPhone</p>
      <p>
        While I do use an Android-based Google Pixel 6a for a lot of experimentation with rooting and low-level system
        manipulation, my go-to phone has been an iPhone since 2012. While iOS (previously iPhone OS) used to be somewhat
        limited in its customization and automation abilities, the addition of the Shortcuts application has opened the
        door to a lot of different customizaiton and automation opens.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to use this page to show some of the Shortcuts I've created. It's my hope that these will both help
        other people, as well as inspire them to create some of their own automations
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't currently have the Shortcuts app installed on your phone, you can redownload it <a

        Delete Latest Photo
      </h2>
      <p>
        This shortcut displays your most recent photo and asks if you'd like to delete it. I keep it around because I
        often download photos quickly just to share with someone. Over time, I found that I'd forget to delete those
        downloaded photos—so I created this shortcut and added it to my Control Center. Its convenient placement makes
        it much easier to offload random photos as soon as I'm done with them

        Erase Clipboard
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a simple shortcut that clears out your clipboard. Useful for those times when you've copied sensetive
        information, like a password, and don't want that sitting on your clipboard where it can be easily copied into
        another application as plaintext

      <!-- Future Reminder -->

        Future Reminder
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes I want to set a quick reminder, but I can't (or don't want to) use Siri to set it. This shortcut asks
        me what I want to be reminded about, and then gives me a few options for the reminder due date:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 Minutes</li>
        <li>30 Minutes</li>
        <li>1 Hour</li>
        <li>2 Hours</li>
        <li>Tomorrow</li>
        <li>Custom</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The custom option allows you to specify an exact due date and time for the reminder. I love this shortcut
        because it makes it simple to create a new reminder on the spot without having to open the Remidners app
      </p>

        Message Last Photo
      </h2>
      <p>
        This shortcut enables you to quickly send a message containing the most recent photo in your photo library.
        After sending the mssage the shortcut asks if you'd like to delete the photo. This one is great for all of the
        those quick photos you take (or save!) to share around, but don't intend on keeping on your phone

        Pause Wifi
      </h2>
      <p>
        Occasionally, I'll leave my house only to discover that my phone is desperately trying to cling to my home Wi-Fi
        from several houses up the street—or even from my front yard. This usually isn't a big deal, but sometimes I
        just want a reliable internet connection after leaving. This shortcut simply disables Wi-Fi on my phone for five
        minutes, then turns it back on and sends me a notification to let me know it's re-enabled. It's really simple,
        but I use it more than almost any other shortcut on my phone
      </p>

        Restart
      </h2>
      <p>
        Do you know how to easily restart your iPhone? I don't. There's a “Power Off” button in the top-right corner of
        the Control Center, but I rarely want to completely shut down my phone. More often than not, I just want to
        restart it because something is misbehaving. I'm not sure why Apple doesn't think we need an easy way to
        restart, but I decided to fix that with this shortcut. I've added it to my Control Center so I can quickly
        access it whenever I need a restart
      </p>

        Show Control Center
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a very simple shortcut that opens the Control Center when run. I currently have it set to activate using
        the Action Button on my phone, but I've also used it as a Home Screen shortcut in the past. I like this shortcut
        because I find it easier than opening the Control Center with the top-right swipe gesture as Apple intends

      <!-- Toggle Ring/Silent -->

        Toggle Ring/Silent
      </h2>
      <p>
        This shortcut has a bit of a niche usecase, because the Control Center already has a ring/silent toggle.
        However, sometimes I want to be able to toggle between ring and silent on my homescreen via a direct shortcut.
        This simple shortcut enables me to do that with little fuss

          style="height: 2.0em; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 0.5em" />
        Tooth Brushing Reminder
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm great at brushing my teeth in the morning, but sometimes I could use some help remembering to do it in the
        evening. I could have just made a boring, vanilla tooth brushing reminder in the Reminders app, but that's not
        very fun. Instead I created this shortcut, which picks from a variety of (admittedly fairly cheesy) pop-culture
        inspired tooth brush alerts that I had Chat GPT create
      </p>
      <p>
        I created an automation in the Shortcuts app that runs this Shortcut every night at 9:30 PM. If nothing else it
        gives me a small chuckle, and I'm now I'm a lot better at actually remembering to brush my teeth in the evening

        YouTube
      </h2>
      <p>
        I <em>really</em> do not like the native YouTube app. It's filled with ads, paywalls features that should come
        standard, and has a pretty bad overall user experience. So I uninstalled it and replaced it with this shortcut
        which simply opens YouTube in Safari, or whatever your default browser is. Add this shortcut to your homescreen
        and you're good to go! If you use Safari then you also benefit from any Safari extensions you may have installed
        which can help make video playback on YouTube more tolerable
