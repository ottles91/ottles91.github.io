      <h1>Apple Shortcuts Automations</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Don't just have an iPhone that looks like every other iPhone</p>
      <p>
        While I do use an Android-based Google Pixel 6a for a lot of experimentation with rooting and low-level system
        manipulation, my go-to phone has been an iPhone since 2012. While iOS (previously iPhone OS) used to be somewhat
        limited in its customization and automation abilities, the addition of the Shortcuts application has opened the
        door to a lot of different customizaiton and automation opens.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to use this page to show some of the Shortcuts I've created. It's my hope that these will both help
        other people, as well as inspire them to create some of their own automations
      </p>

        Show Control Center
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a very simple shortcut that opens the Control Center when run. I currently have it set to activate using
        the Action Button on my phone, but I've also used it as a Home Screen shortcut in the past. I like this shortcut
        because I find it easier than opening the Control Center with the top-right swipe gesture as Apple intends

        Restart
      </h2>
      <p>
        Do you know how to easily restart your iPhone? I don't. There's a “Power Off” button in the top-right corner of
        the Control Center, but I rarely want to completely shut down my phone. More often than not, I just want to
        restart it because something is misbehaving. I'm not sure why Apple doesn't think we need an easy way to
        restart, but I decided to fix that with this shortcut. I've added it to my Control Center so I can quickly
        access it whenever I need a restart.
