        Apple Shortcuts Automations
      </h1>
      <p class="tagline">Don't just have an iPhone that looks and behaves like every other iPhone</p>
      <p>
        While I do use an Android-based Google Pixel 6a for a lot of experimentation with rooting and low-level system
        manipulation, my go-to phone has been an iPhone since 2012. While iOS (previously iPhone OS) used to be somewhat
        limited in its customization and automation abilities, the addition of the Shortcuts application has opened the
        door to a lot of different customizaiton and automation opens.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to use this page to show some of the Shortcuts I've created. It's my hope that these will both help
        other people, as well as inspire them to create some of their own automations
      </p>

        If you don't currently have the Shortcuts app installed on your phone, you can redownload it <a

        Delete Latest Photo
      </h2>
      <p>
        This shortcut displays your most recent photo and asks if you'd like to delete it. I keep it around because I
        often download photos quickly just to share with someone. Over time, I found that I'd forget to delete those
        downloaded photos—so I created this shortcut and added it to my Control Center. Its convenient placement makes
        it much easier to offload random photos as soon as I'm done with them

        Pause Wifi
      </h2>
      <p>
        Occasionally, I'll leave my house only to discover that my phone is desperately trying to cling to my home Wi-Fi
        from several houses up the street—or even from my front yard. This usually isn't a big deal, but sometimes I
        just want a reliable internet connection after leaving. This shortcut simply disables Wi-Fi on my phone for five
        minutes, then turns it back on and sends me a notification to let me know it's re-enabled. It's really simple,
        but I use it more than almost any other shortcut on my phone.

        Restart
      </h2>
      <p>
        Do you know how to easily restart your iPhone? I don't. There's a “Power Off” button in the top-right corner of
        the Control Center, but I rarely want to completely shut down my phone. More often than not, I just want to
        restart it because something is misbehaving. I'm not sure why Apple doesn't think we need an easy way to
        restart, but I decided to fix that with this shortcut. I've added it to my Control Center so I can quickly
        access it whenever I need a restart.

        Show Control Center
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is a very simple shortcut that opens the Control Center when run. I currently have it set to activate using
        the Action Button on my phone, but I've also used it as a Home Screen shortcut in the past. I like this shortcut
        because I find it easier than opening the Control Center with the top-right swipe gesture as Apple intends
