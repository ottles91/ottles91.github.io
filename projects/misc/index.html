            <p>One of the blessings (and curses) that comes with an interest in software development is that I
                <del>occasionally</del> <em>often</em> run into little annoyances/issues in everyday life, and instead
                of going
                out and finding an existing piece of software (like a normal person) to solve my problem, I create my
                own solution. The upside of this is that I have have a pool of different projects that I can pull from
                when I need to demonstrate my development skills. This page will provide a brief overview of
                various projects that I've worked on that haven't quite graduated to having their own page...yet

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Plex Music Data Takeout is a Python tool that lets you export your entire Plex music library into a
                clean,
                portable format. The script safely copies and queries Plex's internal SQLite database to gather detailed
                track information such as title, album, artist, release date, duration, and more, without interfering
                with the running server. The results are written to both CSV and (optionally) Excel, making it easy to
                browse, filter, or analyze your collection outside of Plex. This project is ideal for anyone who wants
                to catalog their library, create backups of metadata, or gain new insights into their listening
                collection.

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reads your Plex <strong>SQLite database</strong> (<code>com.plexapp.plugins.library.db</code>)
                    safely.</li>
                <li>Exports details <strong>all music tracks</strong> with details including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Track Title</li>
                        <li>Artist</li>

                <li>Optionally outputs to Excel (<code>.xlsx</code>) in addition to <code>.csv</code>.</li>
                <li>Makes a safe copy of your Plex database before querying, so the live server is unaffected</li>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Project Line Counter is a lightweight Python command-line utility designed to help developers quickly
                analyze the size and structure of their codebases. It recursively scans a project directory, counts
                lines of code across multiple file types, and provides both a total line count and a breakdown by file
                extension. With options to include or exclude hidden files, skip specific directories or file types, and
                ignore non-text/binary files, it's a flexible tool for getting a clearer picture of your project's
                composition without the overhead of a full-featured code metrics suite.
            </p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scans a directory and its subdirectories</li>
                <li>
                    Supports <strong>multiple file extensions</strong> (e.g. <code>.py</code>, <code>.cs</code>,
                    <code>.js</code>,
                    <code>.swift</code>)
                </li>
                <li>Counts all files if no <code>--ext</code> argument is provided</li>
                <li>Optionally include hidden files and directories with <code>--include-hidden</code></li>
                <li>Optionally exclude certain file extensions or directories when counting all files</li>
                <li>Skips unreadable or binary files (such as images)</li>
                <li>Provides a <strong>breakdown of lines by file type</strong></li>
                <li>Reports the number of skipped non-text/binary files</li>
