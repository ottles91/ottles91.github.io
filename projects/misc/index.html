            <p>One of the blessings (and curses) that comes with an interest in software development is that I
                <del>occasionally</del> <em>often</em> run into little annoyances/issues in everyday life, and instead
                of going
                out and finding an existing piece of software (like a normal person) to solve my problem, I create my
                own solution. The upside of this is that I have have a pool of different projects that I can pull from
                when I need to demonstrate my development skills. This page will provide a brief overview of
                various projects that I've worked on that haven't quite graduated to having their own page...yet
