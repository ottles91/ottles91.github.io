      <!-- How I Work -->
      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Git:</strong> I use Git to manage my codebase, keep branches clean, and make frequent
          commits that tell a clear story.</li>
        <li><strong>Agile/SCRUM:</strong> I've worked in SCRUM teams where I contributed during sprints, standups, and
          retrospectives to keep momentum going.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> I like to get a working MVP up and running quickly so I can test ideas
          early and iterate based on how it actually feels to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD):</strong> I write tests early to catch issues before they happen and
          to keep my code easy to refactor later.</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse Engineering & Customization:</strong> I enjoy tinkering under the hood‚Äîwhether it's
          customizing Android with Magisk or rooting devices to understand how they work from the ground up.</li>
        <li><strong>RESTful APIs:</strong> I've built and tested APIs using Postman and Swagger, and I like making sure
          each endpoint is both clean and well-documented.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility Focus:</strong> I keep accessibility in mind when designing UIs‚ÄîI want the tools I
          build to be usable by as many people as possible, not just tech-savvy users.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> I aim to build interfaces that make sense to real people‚Äîeven the
          ones who don't care how it works under the hood.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Development Philosophy -->
      <h2>My Development Philosophy</h2>
      <p>My software development journey began in 2007 when I accidentally landed in a high school Computer Science
        class. I could have dropped it, but I was instantly hooked by the idea that I could create something
        functional‚Äîeven something as simple as a Fahrenheit-to-Celsius converter. I've always thrived on the feeling of
        writing code and seeing it actually work. Over the years, I've picked up new languages, tools, and experiences
        that have shaped me into a stronger developer. Along the way, I've also developed a personal philosophy around
        how I approach building software. Here are a few of the values that guide my work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clean, maintainable code: </strong>I prefer to be clear rather than clever. I want my code to be
          readable, reusable, and easy to debug‚Äîespecially for future me</li>
        <li><strong>Building for edge cases: </strong>I've always enjoyed anticipating and handling strange inputs,
          incomplete data, and inconsistent formatting</li>
        <li><strong>Iterate & Refine: </strong>I like to quickly build something that works, then gradually improve it
          until it aligns with my vision</li>
        <li><strong>Automate the Boring Stuff: </strong>I don't need to write boilerplate code for the 314th time. If I
          find myself repeating something too often, I'll find a way to automate it</li>
        <li><strong>Software with a Purpose: </strong>Most of my projects are driven by a desire to solve a specific
          problem in my own life. My hope is that others are looking for similar solutions</li>
        <li><strong>Generative AI as an Aid: </strong>I use generative AI to help myself work more efficiently; I allow
          it to do what it does best and I do what I do best</li>
        <li><strong>Human-First Design: </strong>I value intuitive, accessible interfaces that empower users‚Äîregardless
          of their technical prowess</li>
      </ul>

        Immich Photo Server
      </h3>
      <p>
        You know how iOS and Android try to be helpful by automatically backing up all your photos? I think that's
        great‚ÄîI love the peace of mind that comes from knowing I won't lose everything if my phone takes a swim while
        I'm rafting. But I'm also frugal, and I'm not a fan of paying Apple or Google's inflated cloud storage prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immich is a self-hosted alternative to Google Photos that offers automatic backups and a familiar browsing
        experience. With a little tech know-how and a Docker container, you can set up your own private photo server and
        get most of the same features‚Äîwithout the monthly subscription.

        Android Rooting
      </h3>
      <p>
        While I use an iPhone as my daily driver, I picked up a Google Pixel 6a on sale a few years ago out of
        curiosity. I never planned to use it as my main phone‚ÄîI just wanted to experiment with rooting without the risk
        of bricking my primary device.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a developer, I love how rooting lets me dig beneath the surface of Android and customize the experience down
        to the smallest details. I've explored tools like <strong>Magisk</strong> and <strong>Tasker</strong> to
        automate tasks, tweak system behavior, and streamline the interface. It's incredibly satisfying to work with the
        OS at such a low level and see the impact of my changes in real time. </p>

        Emulation Station & RetroArch
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've had a fascination with retro games for as long as I can remember. As I've grown older, I've become
        increasingly interested in game preservation. Many of the titles I loved growing up have become difficult‚Äîor
        outright expensive‚Äîto access, and the companies that could preserve them (hi, Nintendo! üëã) don't always seem
        interested in making their older catalogs available. How am I supposed to play <em>Pok√©mon Alpha Sapphire</em>
        without shelling out for a used 3DS and an overpriced cartridge on eBay?
      </p>
      <p>Enter <strong>Emulation Station</strong> and <strong>RetroArch</strong>, which gave me the tools to build a
        highly customizable retro gaming setup. I picked up a <a
          href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retroid
          Pocket 5</a>, and with a little bit of tinkering, I turned it into a fantastic portable emulation device. I
        enjoyed fine-tuning button mappings, aspect ratios, and performance settings to create a system tailored to my
        preferences.</p>
      <p>As an added bonus, the Retroid Pocket 5 runs Android, so many of the skills I developed while rooting and
        customizing my Pixel 6a carried over. It's been a great way to blend my love of retro gaming with my passion for
        low-level software customization.</p>
