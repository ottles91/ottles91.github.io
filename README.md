# ottles91.github.io

This is the source code for my personal website, hosted at [ottles91.github.io](ottles91.github.io)

The site includes:

- An overview of my work and interests
- Project pages (like Flare and Apple Shortcuts)
- A clean, responsive layout using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 with custom properties (variables)
- JavaScript (vanilla) for HTML includes

## 🚀 How It Works

This site uses a lightweight JS include system to dynamically load shared components like the header and footer. It’s designed to keep things modular without needing a full framework.
